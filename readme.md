* Now user have to pay for the same and also payment page is very secure and dynamic . there you can see the actual car that you have choosen from the car list . 
though car list and the country city list is hardcoded . in the payment page if user put card number grater than 16 numbers and less than 14 numbers it shows alert .
also if any of the fields are empty the Payment page also shows error . and if you are not logged in it alerts to login .
