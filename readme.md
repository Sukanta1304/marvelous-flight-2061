Making navbar with Chakra ui , maintain all the page's data with Appcontext . 
if the user mistakenly skip any field of login the page shows alert that please fill the all fields . 
and also payment page is very secure and dynamic . there you can see the actual car that you have choosen fron the car list . 
though car list and the country city list is hardcoded . 
in the payment page if user put card number grater than 16 numbers and less than 14 numbers it shows alert .
also if any of the fields are empty the Payment page also shows error . 
and if you are not logged in it alerts to login . 
in the side bar you can see all your details , like- Name , email , mobile number that you have filled during registration or login. 
Some bugs are there , I will make more better dynamic in future . 
Thank you .
